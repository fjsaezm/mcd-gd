Big data management
---

In this subject, we have made 4 assignments:

- In the first one, we tried to **deanonymize** our own teacher (with his previous permission) from the UAM teachers' database using the data available on the internet and in the UAM's database itself  (Folder [P1](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-gd/tree/main/P1))

- In the second one, we create a **pipeline** that simulates a diary action performed on two different *.csv* files and that aims to extract the relevant data for a certain query on this data (Folder [P2](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-gd/tree/main/P2))

- In the third one, we perform an exploratory analysis of a **CardSorting** dataset that contains items from a supermarket (Folder [P3](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-gd/tree/main/P4))

- In the last one, we created a very simple report in **PowerBI**, using data relative to the COVID19 pandemic (Folder [P4](https://github.com/fjsaezm/mcd-gd/tree/main/P4))
